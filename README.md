A **bug bounty** is a cybersecurity program where companies invite security researchers to find and responsibly report vulnerabilities in their websites, apps, or systems. If a valid security issue is discovered and reported with clear proof, the researcher may receive a **reward** (money, recognition, swag, or points), depending on the severity and impact.

Bug bounty programs help organizations improve security by identifying real-world weaknesses before attackers exploit them.
